üåü **Unlocking the Power of Python Decorators: A Simple Example with `arg_from_file`** üåü

In the world of Python programming, decorators are like the secret sauce that can enhance and extend the functionality of your code without modifying its core structure. But what exactly is a decorator, and why should you care?

üîç **What is a Decorator?**

A decorator in Python is a special function that wraps another function to add new functionality. Think of it as a way to "decorate" your existing functions with additional capabilities, much like adding a new feature to your favourite app without changing its original code.

üìà **Why Use Decorators?**

Decorators are powerful because they allow you to:
- **Re-use Code Efficiently**: Apply the same enhancement to multiple functions without repeating code.
- **Keep Code Clean and Readable**: Separate core logic from auxiliary features.
- **Enhance Flexibility**: Easily modify or extend functionality as requirements evolve.

üí° **Custom Decorator**

In this tech blog, we look at a practical example: our custom `arg_from_file` decorator. With this decorator, any function can seamlessly accept either a direct string or a file path containing the string. It's a simple yet elegant solution that saves time and effort!

üöÄ **Why This Matters in Analytics**

As someone deeply involved in Python analytics, leveraging decorators like `arg_from_file` can streamline data processing tasks, enhance code maintainability, and ultimately deliver insights cleaner and faster. Whether you're automating data ingestion or optimising data transformation pipelines, decorators can be an invaluable tool in your Python toolkit.

## More about Python Decorators

In Python, decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions. There are lots of built-in decorators in the standard libraries, for example:

- `@functools.cache`: Think of this as a memory aid for your function. It remembers the results of previous calls, so if you ask for the same thing again, it quickly gives you the stored answer instead of recalculating everything. It's like a smart calculator that remembers your previous calculations.
- `@contextlib.contextmanager`: This is like a helpful assistant for setting up and cleaning up tasks. It ensures that certain things happen before and after a specific operation, similar to how you might prepare a workspace before starting a project and then tidy up afterward.
- `@dataclasses.dataclass`:
This is a shortcut for creating classes that mainly hold data. It automatically adds common methods that you'd typically have to write yourself, saving you time and reducing errors. It's almost like having a robot assistant that fills in standard paperwork for you.
- `@functools.wraps`: This decorator helps maintain the identity of a function when it's being modified by another function. It's like ensuring that a book keeps its original cover and description even if you add notes or highlights to its pages. This helps other parts of the program recognise and work with the function correctly, even after it's been wrapped or modified.

and you can also create your own.

## Example: Custom `arg_from_file` Decorator

Let's take a look at a practical example: the `arg_from_file` decorator. Imagine you have several functions that take string inputs, but sometimes these strings are stored in files. Instead of writing code to read from files every time, you can use the `arg_from_file` decorator to handle this for you automatically.


```python
from pathlib import Path
from functools import wraps

def arg_from_file(content_arg="content", encoding="utf-8"):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            content = kwargs.get(content_arg)
            if content and Path(content).is_file():
                with open(content, 'r', encoding=encoding) as file:
                    kwargs[content_arg] = file.read()
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

### Motivation: Some use cases

#### SQL queries in DuckDB

```python
import duckdb

@arg_from_file("query")
def execute_duckdb_query(conn: duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection, query: str):
    return conn.execute(query).fetchdf()

conn = duckdb.connect('my_database.db')
result = execute_duckdb_query(conn, "path/to/my_query.sql")
```

How It Works:

- **Decorator Magic**: The `@arg_from_file("query")` line is like a helper that prepares the function to read from a file if needed.
- **Calling the Function**: When you call `execute_duckdb_query` with a path to an SQL file (like `"path/to/my_query.sql"`), the helper checks if that path points to a file.
- **Reading the File**: If it finds a file, it reads the SQL query from that file instead of using the path.
- **Running the Query**: The function then runs the actual SQL command in [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) it just read and gives you the results.

This setup lets you keep your SQL commands in separate files, making them easier to manage and update without cluttering your main code.

#### Markdown in Streamlit apps

```python
import streamlit as st

@arg_from_file("content")
def display_markdown(content: str):
    st.markdown(content)

display_markdown("path/to/my_content.md")
```

How It Works:

- **Decorator Magic**: Similar to the SQL example, `@str_from_file("content")` helps this function know it can read from a file.
- **Calling the Function**: When you call `display_markdown` with a path to a Markdown file (like `"path/to/my_content.md"`), it checks if that path points to a file.
- **Reading the File**: If it finds a file, it reads the text from that Markdown file instead of using the path.
Displaying Content: The function then shows that text in your [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

This approach allows you to keep your written content (like articles or notes) in separate files, making it easier to write and edit without mixing it with your code.

### Motivation and Benefits

1. Separation of Concerns:
   - Keeping SQL queries and Markdown content in separate files allows for better organisation and maintainability of your code.
   - It's easier to version control and manage changes to your queries and content when they're in dedicated files.

2. Reusability:
   - SQL queries stored in separate files can be reused across different parts of your application or even in different projects.
   - Markdown content can be easily shared and reused in various contexts, such as documentation or different parts of your Streamlit app.

3. Collaboration:
   - Team members with different expertise (e.g., data analysts writing SQL, content writers creating Markdown) can work on their respective files without interfering with the main application code.

4. Readability:
   - Your main Python code remains clean and focused on logic, while the SQL and Markdown content are stored in their native formats with appropriate syntax highlighting.

5. Easy Maintenance:
   - Updates to queries or content can be made directly in the `.sql` or `.md` files without touching the Python code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

6. Performance:
   - For frequently used queries or content, you can implement caching mechanisms more easily when they're stored in separate files.

7. Security:
   - Sensitive queries can be stored separately from the main code, allowing for better access control and security practices.

8. Flexibility:
   - You can easily switch between different queries or content by changing the file path, without modifying the core application code.

By using the `arg_from_file` decorator, you seamlessly integrate these external files into your Python functions, maintaining the benefits of separation while keeping your code clean and intuitive.
